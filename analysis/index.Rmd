Welcome to my research website for a project to analyse the behaviour of bees using k-means cluster analysis, a popular machine learning method.

The site has two main tabs, the first being "Overview" wich gives a high level explanation of the problem that this project solves and why the method is useful while second tab, "Paper" is a rough draft which we intend to  become a scientific paper. "N Clusters" gives and in depth analysis performed in Python to determine the segment length and number of clusters that obtains the maximum information from the data.

Feel free to browse as you wish and if you have any questions or want to comment on anything I'd love for you to get in touch. I especially welcome feedback and constructive criticism!
