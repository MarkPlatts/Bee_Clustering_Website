Welcome to my research website for a project to analyse the behaviour of bees using k-means cluster analysis, a popular machine learning method.

The site has two main tabs. The first tabe gives a high level explanation of the problem that this project solves and why the method is useful while second tab is a rough draft on which we hope to base a paper. Feel free to browse as you wish and if you have any questions or want to comment on anything I'd love for you to get in touch. I especially welcome feedback and constructive criticism!
